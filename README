SRA - Squirrel Registration Authority


This convention management registration system is born out of the old GAGG registrations system. It adds functionality to create and manage conventions.

To install it you will need a few things:

Postgres
Apache
PHP
Codeigniter System folder

It includes a .htaccess to remove the codeigniter index.php from URLs which could cause it to blow up on your system if you don't have rights to use .htaccess.
